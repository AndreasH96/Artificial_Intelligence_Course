2.e)
"Ground feeder cable in ground" is maximised at a value of 99.94% with Season = Summer, Cause = Other, Switchgear = H7
"Fabricationfault" is maximised at a value of 99.85% with Season = Spring, Year = after2011, Outage duration = Otg>2, Switchgear = H3, Facility part = Other secondary substation


2.f)
3 highly positive correlations:
    1. Facility part = Ground cable pillar is highly correlated with Cause = Fuse Break 
        p(Facility part = Ground cable pillar | Cause = Fuse Break) = 78.44%

    2. Facility part = Ground feeder cable in ground is highly correlated with Cause = Digging 
        p(Facility part = Ground feeder cable in ground | Cause = Digging) = 56.20%

    3. Cause = Fabricationfault is highly correlated with Outage duration = Otg>2
        p(Cause = Fabricationfault | Outage duration = Otg>2) = 42.82%

3 highly negative correlations:
    1. Cause = Rain has a low correlation with Season = Autumn
        p(Cause = Rain | Season = Autumn) = 0.00%
    
    2. Facility part = Ground cable pillar has a low correlation with Cause = Falling tree by wind
        p(Facility part = Ground cable pillar | Cause = Falling tree by wind) = 4.86%
    
    3. Cause = Fuse Break has a low correlation with Outage duration = Otg>2
        p(Cause = Fuse break | Outage duration = Otg>2) = 9.98%
